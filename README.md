# My Personal Project

## UBC SafeWalk

This application is for UBC SafeWalk. The service is available seven days a week, from 8 pm to 2 am, during the academic year, and is an important resource for anyone who feels unsafe walking alone on campus after dark. It is available to all members of the UBC community. 
One can either choose to be a volunteer and accompany individuals on foot to on-campus locations such as residences, libraries, classrooms, and parking lots late at night; or they can be users who avail this service and choose a volunteer in cases where they feel unsafe and 
require assistance.

## Who will use it?

It is also for those who want to volunteer and help make the UBC campus safer,
## Inspiration behind this project

As a UBC student in first year with friends that live in various different residences, I have noticed that a lot of the students choose to walk to various locations on campus past midnight despite the safety risk. This application aims to counter this and helps create a 
safer and more comfortable environment for UBC students.
